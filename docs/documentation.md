# MarketPlaceLens Documentation

MarketPlaceLens is a self-hosted marketplace watcher. It turns user-supplied search URLs into recurring jobs, stores normalized listings locally, and gives users a focused workflow for reviewing, saving, hiding, contacting, and assessing items.

## 1. Installation

Requirements:

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2

Install with the published release image:

```bash
mkdir -p marketplacelens && cd marketplacelens
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexRosbach/MarketPlaceLens/main/docker-compose.install.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Open:

```text
http://<your-host-ip>:8091
```

On first start, MarketPlaceLens displays a platform-rules notice and then creates the first admin password. No normal deployment ships with a default password.

For local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

## 2. Core Concepts

### Jobs

A job is a saved search. It stores:

- source type
- source URL
- poll interval
- listing type options
- local filters
- notification choices
- owning user

Admins can manage all jobs. Normal users can create, run, edit, and delete their own jobs.

### Listings

A listing is a normalized result imported from a job run. Listings carry title, price, location, category, marketplace URL, image URL, source status, user status, watchlist state, contacted state, and optional AI assessment text.

### Watchlists

Every user can choose a default watchlist. A normal watch action saves the listing to that default list. Marking a listing as contacted also adds it to the default watchlist, because contacted items should remain easy to find later.

### Review Mode

Review mode shows one listing at a time with image, price, location, source, AI assessment, and actions. Users can open the source listing, save to watchlist, mark contacted, mark seen, or generate AI text.

## 3. Source Status

| Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kleinanzeigen | Stable primary path | Best-supported connector. Supports public search/category URLs, price, age, keyword, location/radius, and listing type handling. |
| Facebook Marketplace | **In testing** | Works only when Facebook returns listing links to the server. Facebook frequently returns login, consent, location, or JavaScript shell pages. Optional Cookie headers are stored locally and sent only to `facebook.com`. |
| mobile.de | **In testing** | Reads public search pages when embedded vehicle result data is available. The official mobile.de Search API needs separate Basic Auth access. |
| Generic HTML | Experimental | Basic fallback for simple link-card result pages. It is not a universal parser. |

MarketPlaceLens does not bypass login walls, CAPTCHA, bot protection, private APIs, blocked sessions, or platform access controls.

## 4. Creating Jobs

Use **Quick job** when starting from a simple idea. The wizard guides through:

1. source
2. search term
3. category
4. price and location limits
5. keyword rules
6. polling and notification choices

Use **New job** when you already have a concrete marketplace URL. The manual editor includes provider cards, URL parameter previews, Kleinanzeigen listing-type controls, text or map-based location criteria, keyword rules, and delivery settings.

For Kleinanzeigen, a text location such as `10115 · +50 km` is translated into URL parameters. If the map mode is used, MarketPlaceLens reverse-geocodes the clicked point into a ZIP/place first and then uses that resolved location for Kleinanzeigen.

## 5. Listing Workflow

Listings can be:

- filtered by status, job, watchlist, text, price, and sort order
- viewed in list or tile mode
- opened on the original marketplace
- marked seen or hidden
- saved to a watchlist
- marked contacted
- shown on a map by ZIP/place
- enriched with AI assessment text

The default active listing view excludes seen and hidden items unless the user explicitly changes filters.

## 6. Notifications

Notification settings are split into Telegram and webhook configuration cards. Each job decides whether it sends Telegram and/or webhook notifications.

Global rate limiting avoids aggressive polling. Per-job intervals are constrained by the configured minimum interval.

## 7. AI Features

AI is disabled by default. Admins can enable it and configure an OpenAI-compatible provider:

- OpenAI API
- Ollama
- LM Studio

AI can generate:

- buyer inquiry text for manual copying
- structured quick-job drafts
- listing assessments

Listing assessments focus on fit to the saved search, practical value, resale potential, visible risk signs, missing details, and whether the price looks plausible against a typical used-market range.

AI requests may send listing title, price, description, source metadata, match data, and user-provided buyer profile fields to the configured provider.

## 8. Users and Roles

Admin users can:

- manage all jobs and listings
- manage users and roles
- configure notifications, AI, Facebook settings, watchlists, and run logs
- clear individual or all run errors

Normal users can:

- manage their own jobs
- review listings from their own jobs
- use watchlists
- choose a default watchlist
- edit account and buyer profile fields
- change their password

## 9. Settings

Settings are grouped into:

- Notifications
- Facebook
- AI
- Watchlists
- Users
- Recent runs
- Account

Facebook settings include a setup guide and optional Cookie header field. The Cookie value is masked in UI/API responses and is intended only for private self-hosted use when the URL works in the admin's own browser session.

## 10. Updating

Pull the latest release image:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

For checkout-based installs:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

SQLite schema migrations run during startup.

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Source returns no listings

Check the run logs first. Some platforms return empty HTML, login pages, consent pages, or JavaScript shells to server requests.

### Facebook fails

Facebook Marketplace is **in testing**. If the URL works only in your browser, add a browser Cookie header in Settings. Cookies expire, can be revoked, and may still not make the server response usable.

### mobile.de fails

mobile.de is **in testing**. Use a concrete public search result URL. If mobile.de returns no embedded result data or blocks the request, MarketPlaceLens records a connector error.

### AI request fails

Use **Test AI** in Settings. Local Ollama and LM Studio models can take longer on the first request while the model loads.

### Browser shows stale UI

The app appends the build code to local CSS and JavaScript URLs. If a browser still shows old controls, do a hard reload.

## 12. Version Metadata

`GET /api/version` returns:

- `version`
- `build_code`
- `commit`
- `branch`
- `created`

The build code also appears in the sidebar badge.

## 13. Compliance Boundaries

MarketPlaceLens is intended for private self-hosted use with URLs the operator is allowed to access.

- No login automation
- No CAPTCHA bypass
- No proxy rotation
- No aggressive polling
- No automatic seller messaging
- No public redistribution of marketplace data
- No local thumbnail mirroring; images are proxied on demand
