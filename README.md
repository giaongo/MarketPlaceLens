## Why It Is Different

Most marketplace providers are optimized for browsing inside one platform. MarketPlaceLens is built for focused buying research across saved searches:

- More granular search control: combine provider search URLs with local include, exclude, required keyword, category, price, age, location, radius, status, and watchlist filters.
- Better matching workflow: normalize listings into one local review queue, hide noise, keep contacted items, and save promising items to watchlists instead of repeating the same provider searches.
- Built-in AI assistance: turn natural-language buying intent into quick-job drafts, generate buyer messages, and add listing assessments that highlight fit, price plausibility, missing details, and visible risk signs.
- Self-hosted ownership: data, settings, cookies, API keys, watchlists, and review history stay on the operator's server.
- No lock-in to one marketplace UI: supported sources can evolve independently while the review, notification, and AI workflow stays the same.
