# Changelog

All notable changes to MarketPlaceLens are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- First visit now chooses the UI language from the browser language when the user has not saved a language preference yet.
- Facebook Marketplace settings now include a setup guide for Marketplace URLs and optional browser Cookie headers.
- First-run setup now shows a scraping and platform-rules notice before the admin account form.
- Listing cards now show whether a buyer has already contacted the seller, with a quick toggle in list and swipe views.
- Facebook Marketplace jobs can use an optional locally stored Cookie header from the admin settings when the URL only works in an authenticated browser session.
- The review flow now uses larger product-focused cards with inline actions inspired by the Kramlet card layout.
- Quick jobs can now generate a structured search draft from one natural-language sentence through the configured AI provider.
- Admin settings now include an AI provider test action to verify OpenAI/Ollama/LM Studio connectivity from the running container.
- Job notification choices now present background polling, Telegram, and webhook delivery as first-class options in both quick and manual job setup.
- Admins can now delete individual run errors or clear all run-error logs to reset the dashboard error counter.
- Listings can now show an optional saved AI assessment that summarizes fit and visible caution signs directly on listing and review cards.
- AI listing assessments now have a separate automatic mode for visible listing batches, with an in-settings warning about potential token usage.

### Changed

- Facebook Marketplace search URLs copied from the `marketplace/np/.../search` view are normalized to the standard Marketplace search path before fetching.
- Facebook Cookie settings now fail fast with a clear message when the stored browser Cookie lacks the logged-in `c_user`/`xs` session pair.
- Facebook Marketplace requests now normalize pasted browser headers to the real Cookie value and include browser navigation headers.
- The Listings view now uses a compact modern work header with job run controls, search, view switching, filters, pagination, and a mobile bottom navigation.
- Listing tiles and swipe cards now use the fuller Scan Card treatment, while list view keeps the compact scan row with actions on the right and mobile-friendly stacked actions.
- Language, version, and light/dark theme controls now match Kramlet's bottom-right floating display-options control instead of living in the top header.
- Review cards are now more Kramlet-like on phones, with the actions inside the product card and compact mobile sizing so a listing fits into one screen more reliably.
- The Review section is now labeled Swipe/Swipen and its product cards show the same marketplace date, ZIP, and place details as listing cards.
- Language and light/dark theme controls now use Kramlet-style quick buttons on login and in the main header instead of select menus.
- Settings now use LanLens-style tabs for Notifications, Facebook, AI, Watchlists, Users, Recent runs, and Account instead of one long admin stack.
- Notification settings are split into Telegram, webhook, and delivery-rule cards for clearer channel configuration.
- The default watchlist is now saved per user, and non-admin users can manage their own Watchlist settings tab.
- UI cards, buttons, and list items now use stronger shadows, hover motion, and subtle entrance animation with reduced-motion support.
- Run-error cleanup controls now use clearer copy in the dashboard and settings.

### Fixed

- Kleinanzeigen "Passwort vergessen?" and "Erstelle ein Konto" account-page artifacts are now filtered at parse time, excluded from listing API responses, and cleaned from existing local data on startup.
- Mobile listing, watchlist, settings, and swipe screens were audited; the floating language/theme control no longer covers card actions on phones, listing titles get full width before badges, and settings tabs use a denser two-column mobile layout.
- Listings now respect iPhone safe-area spacing, keep the job selector and run action visible outside the collapsible filter panel, and show run errors as toasts.
- Each job run now rechecks unseen listings and records whether they are active, reserved, deleted, or currently unknown.
- Kleinanzeigen scans now read listing dates from `time` metadata and, when a result card omits the date, from the listing detail page before saving the listing. Cards no longer show an "unknown" date chip when the source still does not provide a date.
- Duplicate listing refreshes now backfill missing marketplace fields such as price, location, description, and image; invalid Kleinanzeigen account links are cleaned up; notifications sit above the floating display controls; and watchlist chevrons render as proper icons.
- Listing and review cards now label the marketplace listing date plus ZIP code and place instead of showing an unlabeled location or internal discovery time.
- Mobile swipe-card action buttons no longer scroll under the right edge or clip the Seen button.
- Mobile listing controls now align the collapsed filter chevron and watchlist split-button chevrons cleanly.
- HTML pages now load build-versioned CSS and JavaScript assets to prevent stale mobile browser caches from showing raw translation keys after updates.
- Local Ollama and LM Studio calls now get a longer provider timeout, which avoids failing while local models are still loading.
- Kleinanzeigen paginated scans now keep the HTTP client open while following result pages.
- Kleinanzeigen parsing now uses dedicated result-card selectors instead of the generic HTML fallback.
- Kleinanzeigen jobs now pass text location and radius hints to the source URL and avoid exact ZIP text filtering for radius-based searches.
- Existing duplicate listings are re-evaluated during profile runs so corrected filters can restore previously hidden items.
- Listing page-size controls now honor 50 and 100 item options, with 100 as the default.
- Facebook connector errors now distinguish anonymous access/login blocks from empty result pages.
- Responsive controls, listing cards, pagination, and headers wrap more defensively to avoid UI overlaps.
